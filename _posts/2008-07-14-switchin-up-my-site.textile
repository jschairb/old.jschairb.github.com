h1. {{ page.title }}

I've switched my blog from "Mephisto":http://www.mephistoblog.com to "RadiantCMS":http://www.radiantcms.org.  During the transition, I deleted some articles which weren't really relevant anymore and I might have jacked up the feed.  I primarily switched because I had to use Radiant for something at work and I really liked it, but I also wanted to completely redesign the style, and I'm very pleased with that.  I've gone with a very minimalist approach, without images.

Switching to Radiant wasn't the simplest things, and some stuff had to be done by hand, but I recommend it if you want something more than a blog, but less than an over-the-top CMS (which Radiant could be, but has a very simple interface).  I know that I've lost some Google link juice because I'm not handling all the redirects, but it's just not that important to me.

I'm working on getting the tags back, but I'll probably ditch the categories for good.  Comments are enabled for the moment.  Look for a post later on about the perfect blog setup for Radiant.  I want to use this URL as a means of experimentation of Radiant, XHTML, CSS, unobtrusive javascript techniques and anything else that I come across. We'll see.
