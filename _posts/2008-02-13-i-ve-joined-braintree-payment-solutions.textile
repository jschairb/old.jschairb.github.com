<div class="article_image">!http://www.grokblok.com/assets/2008/2/13/logo.gif!</div>It's been a while since I've posted, and it's also been a while since I changed jobs.  I'm very pleased to announce that I now work for "Braintree Payment Solutions":http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com.  I've been putting all my energy into helping our CEO, "Bryan Johnson":http://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanrjohnson make Braintree _the_ place for discerning developers, and I think the combination of our support, technology, and services offered place us at the top of the industry.    In short, it's a credit card payment gateway, but it's way more than that.  Here's the description from "Braintree":http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/braintree-payment-solutions-corporate-overview/m/1/:

bq. Braintree Payment Solutions is a leading provider of end-to-end electronic payment products and services. Braintree processes all forms of electronic payment transactions - credit, debit, electronic check, and electronic funds transfer. The company offers simplified PCI Compliance and credit card storage solutions, risk and fraud management, ecommerce solutions, and rate management. We're changing the industry one customer at a time and would invite you to experience the difference.

Officially, my role is "Community Developer", which sounds a bit ambiguous, but it's actually a perfect title for what I'm going to be doing.  I'm in charge of all things developer at Braintree, so I'm focused on Developing the Community and also Developing _for_ the Community.  In short, you can check out my work on the "Braintree Community Developer Site":http://developer.getbraintree.com which will include a "blog":http://developer.getbraintree.com/blog, "support forums":http:/developer.getbraintree.com, api docs, code examples, and all the information that you'll need to easily integrate payment processing into your own applications.  

The site is currently a little sparse on content, but we're adding more everyday and I'm completely focused on making it the _definitive_ place for information on credit card processing, payment gateways, and integration issues for developers in all communities.  Initially, we're focusing on Ruby on Rails developers, but we welcome developers from all languages and frameworks.  If you have any suggestions or feedback, please contact me at developer@getbraintree.com.

Needless to say, I'm very excited to be a part of such a great company and I'm looking forward to helping people navigate through a very complicated industry.
