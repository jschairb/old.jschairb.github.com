So, it would appear that the -Rails- trademark "discussion":http://www.rubyinside.com/david-heinemeier-hansson-says-no-to-use-of-rails-logo-567.html isn't quite over.  On the 27th of July, "Dr. Nic Williams":http://drnicwilliams registered a trademark for:

* Educational publications, namely, training manuals in the field of information technology
* Dissemination of advertising, scheduling and managing of training courses and programs for others via a global computer
* Arranging professional workshop and training courses

This is in addition to the one originally "filed by David Heinemeier Hansson":http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=77119206 about the usage of -Ruby on Rails- in _Computer software, namely, software framework for developing web applications_.  Apparently, that one isn't completely through the door, yet.

What does all this mean?  1) Patent and trademark law seems completely jacked up in the US.  2) It means that the name of a thing is valuable, not the thing itself.

For those of you thinking about filing a trademark on your service, let me ask a question.  Are you a great -Rails- developer, or are you a great developer who uses -Rails-?
