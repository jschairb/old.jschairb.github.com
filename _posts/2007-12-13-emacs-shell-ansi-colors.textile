In a "previous post":http://www.grokblok.com/2007/9/18/emacs-autotest-integration I mentioned a funky character encoding issue with my Emacs Autotest output.  I finally looked into the cause and came across the solution.  I just needed to enable ansi-colors in my Emacs shell.

In your .emacs file, add the following:


{% highlight cl %}
;; Add color to a shell running in emacs 'M-x shell'
(autoload 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on "ansi-color" nil t)
(add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on)
{% endhighlight %}

Cheap and easy.  Now, you'll get all the cool ansi colors, like the kids.
