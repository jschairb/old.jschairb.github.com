Once of the benefits of never throwing anything is away is going back and finding pieces of information that you've acquired over the years.  For instance, I was cleaning out my garage this weekend when I stumbled upon a packet from a seminar titled, "Peak Performance for Wrestling: Sport Psychology Training for Mental Toughness" given by Dr. Chris Stankovich, of "Champion Athletic Consulting":http://www.championathletic.com.   This was a great seminar and some of these principles I've tried to translate for myself off the mat and into the cubicle. 

The basic gist of the seminar was establishing peak performance in wrestling by setting goals of varying length while focusing on 3 elements: physical, technical, and mental.  As I was reading this, it brought to my mind the benefits that those of us in the technology field could take as lessons learned. The analogy may be a stretch for some, but stick with me.  No group of individuals have a more focused "singularity of purpose" than wrestlers.  I think it could be said that those in technology or even business rely on many of the same principles.  While most of us are part of a team, when all the fat is boiled it, it's all about individual performance.
